# Design Dialogues:
## Benchmarking a Chat-Based Approach to Designing Sustainable Concrete.

### Abstract
As the construction industry seeks eco-friendly alternatives to traditional materials, Alkali-Activated Concrete (AAC) emerges with both promise and complexity due to its varied compositions. Traditional design methods struggle to address AAC's expansive combinatorial space. This research introduces a novel, chat-based design approach employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle this challenge. By comparing two dominant LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, against established data-driven methods like Bayesian Optimization and Sequential Learning across 240 AAC formulations, preliminary results underscore the efficacy of LLMs, especially in early design stages. By favoring a conversational interface over conventional numerical vectors, this methodology not only elevates accuracy but also democratizes data-driven material design. This groundbreaking shift holds the potential to catalyze a more sustainable trajectory in construction.
