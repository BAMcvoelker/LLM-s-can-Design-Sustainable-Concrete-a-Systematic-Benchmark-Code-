Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing",27.77
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing.",51.22
"The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",51.07
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing.",37.52
"Based on the previous results, I suggest the following formulation for maximum compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 390, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",57.2
"Apologies for the confusion. Based on the updated request, I suggest the following formulation for maximum compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",53.79
"Based on the updated request, here is a new suggestion for an even better formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 360, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing.",33.83
"Based on the updated request, I suggest the following unique formulation for maximum compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",55.82
"Based on the updated request, here is a new suggestion for an even better and unique formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 370, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",42.72
"Apologies for the confusion. Based on the updated request, I suggest the following unique formulation for maximum compressive strength:
