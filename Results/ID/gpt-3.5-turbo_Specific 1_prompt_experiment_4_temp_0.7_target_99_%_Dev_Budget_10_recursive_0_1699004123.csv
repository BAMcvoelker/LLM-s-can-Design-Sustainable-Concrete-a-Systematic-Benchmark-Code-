"Based on extensive analysis and experimentation, including new data from recent laboratory tests, I recommend the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.

This formulation pushes the powder content to 430 kg/m³, which is slightly higher than the previous recommendation. The higher powder content promotes better particle packing and enhances the pozzolanic reaction, resulting in increased compressive strength.

Moreover, the WC ratio remains at 0.5, which maintains the balance between workability and strength.

In terms of materials, we are now using a ratio of 0.7/0.3 for Fly-Ash/GGBFS. This ratio has not been previously tested and provides a higher GGBFS content, which is known to contribute to improved compressive strength.

Lastly, heat curing is recommended to accelerate the geopolymerization process, leading to a higher strength gain compared to ambient curing.

By implementing this bold and distinctive formulation, we anticipate achieving even higher compressive strength results in the laboratory.",38.43

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.

In this formulation, we significantly increase the powder content to 450 kg/m³, which exceeds the previous recommendations. This higher powder content will further enhance particle packing and maximize the pozzolanic reaction, resulting in a potentially higher compressive strength.

To complement the increased powder content, we lower the WC ratio to 0.45. This reduced water content will help minimize porosity and increase the density of the concrete, leading to improved strength.

We maintain the materials ratio at 0.5/0.5, as it has been shown to provide a good balance between FA and GGBFS content. The equal distribution of these materials helps optimize the compressive strength.
