"Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Based on the given parameter grid and taking into account the previous results, the next unique suggestion for the best concrete formulation to maximize compressive strength is:

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",27.16
