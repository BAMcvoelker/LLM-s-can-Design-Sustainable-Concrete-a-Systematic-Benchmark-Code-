"Based on the previous results, I suggest the following formulation for maximum compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 380, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",41.15
"Apologies for the duplicate suggestion. Based on the available data and to provide a unique suggestion, I recommend the following formulation for even higher compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing.",25.2
