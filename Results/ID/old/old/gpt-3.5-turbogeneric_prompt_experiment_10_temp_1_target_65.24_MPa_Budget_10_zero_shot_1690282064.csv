Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing",56.56
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing",43.5
"The formulation is Powderkg = 390, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient curing.",47.13
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",39.8
"I apologize for the confusion. Based on the previous results and taking into consideration the design rules, I would suggest the following unique formulation for maximum compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",51.07
"I apologize for the oversight in my previous suggestion. Let me provide you with a new unique formulation that has not been tested before to potentially achieve even better results:

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",39.19
"Certainly! Here's a unique formulation suggestion that has not been validated before:

The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing.",49.59
"Certainly, here is a unique formulation suggestion that has not been validated before:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",44.49
"Based on your request for an even better suggestion, here is a unique formulation that has not been validated before:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",57.37
