Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient",60.18
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat",57.54
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat",56.66
"The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat",57.27
"Based on the previous results and the general design principles, it seems that a powder content of 400 kg and a water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 with a 0.5/0.5 FA/GGBFS ratio under ambient curing conditions yielded the highest compressive strength. However, to push the boundaries and explore a distinctive and untested formulation, we will adjust the parameters slightly while adhering to the principles that govern the mix design.

Given that heat curing at 420 kg of powder content did not surpass the strength achieved at 400 kg under ambient conditions, and considering that a higher powder content under heat curing is expected to perform better, we will increase the powder content slightly to see if we can enhance the compressive strength further. We will also maintain the optimal FA/GGBFS ratio and water-to-cement ratio that have been shown to be effective.

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat

This recommendation is distinctive and yet to be confirmed, and it should provide us with valuable data on the performance of a slightly higher powder content under heat curing conditions with the optimal FA/GGBFS and water-to-c",60.28
