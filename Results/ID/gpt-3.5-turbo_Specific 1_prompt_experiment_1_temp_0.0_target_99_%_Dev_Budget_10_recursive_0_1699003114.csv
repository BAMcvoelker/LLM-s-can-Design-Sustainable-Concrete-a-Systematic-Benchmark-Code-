Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = ambient",60.18
"Based on the previous results and design insights, I recommend the following formulation for a superior compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = heat curing.",62.29
"Based on your desire for a distinctive and unvalidated recommendation, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = heat curing.

This formulation pushes the boundaries by increasing the powder content to 430 kg/m³, which enhances particle packing and the pozzolanic reaction. The lower water-to-cement ratio of 0.45 reduces porosity and increases strength. Additionally, the higher ratio of fly ash to GGBFS at 0.7/0.3 provides a greater amount of fly ash, which can contribute to improved strength.

By combining these factors with heat curing, which accelerates the geopolymerization process, this formulation has the potential to achieve superior compressive strength compared to previous recommendations.",39.8
"Based on your desire for a distinctive and unvalidated recommendation, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = heat curing.

This formulation pushes the boundaries by increasing the powder content to 450 kg/m³, which further enhances particle packing and the pozzolanic reaction. The higher water-to-cement ratio of 0.6 provides a slightly more workable mix, while still maintaining a balance between workability and strength. Additionally, the equal ratio of fly ash to GGBFS at 0.5/0.5 ensures a balanced blend of materials.
