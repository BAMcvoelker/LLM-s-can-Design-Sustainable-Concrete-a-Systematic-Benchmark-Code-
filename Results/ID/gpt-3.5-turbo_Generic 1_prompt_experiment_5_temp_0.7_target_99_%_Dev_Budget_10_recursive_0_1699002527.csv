Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = heat curing",64.28
"Based on the previous results and the general design principles, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = heat curing.

By slightly increasing the powder content to 430 kg/m³, we can further enhance the compressive strength. The optimal balance between FA and GGBFS at a ratio of 0.5/0.5 ensures a dominant GGBFS presence, contributing to improved strength. The water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 maintains a good balance between workability and strength. Lastly, heat curing accelerates the geopolymerization process, resulting in higher strength.

This proposal aims to push the boundaries and achieve even higher compressive strength. It is a distinctive approach that requires further testing to confirm its effectiveness.",63.47
"Certainly! In order to provide a distinctive and bold recommendation, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = heat curing.

By increasing the powder content to 450 kg/m³, we can further enhance the compressive strength. This higher powder content will improve particle packing and the pozzolanic reaction, resulting in increased strength. Additionally, a lower water-to-cement ratio of 0.45 will reduce porosity and enhance the overall strength of the concrete.

Furthermore, using a higher ratio of 0.7/0.3 for Fly-Ash/GGBFS materials will maximize the geopolymerization process, leading to improved strength. The dominant presence of Fly-Ash in this ratio will provide additional benefits, such as improved workability and durability.

Lastly, heat curing will accelerate the geopolymerization process, allowing for faster strength development and higher overall compressive strength.

This proposal is distinctive and yet to be confirmed, as it pushes the boundaries of the recommended parameters. Further testing and validation in the laboratory will be necessary to verify its effectiveness.",38.63
