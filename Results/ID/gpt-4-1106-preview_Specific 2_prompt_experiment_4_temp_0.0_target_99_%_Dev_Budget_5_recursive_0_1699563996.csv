"Given the previous results and the general design principles, it seems that increasing the powder content under heat curing beyond 420 kg/mÂ³ leads to a decrease in compressive strength. However, we have not yet explored the lower end of the powder content spectrum with an optimal water-to-cement ratio under heat curing conditions. To push the boundaries and explore a distinctive and yet unconfirmed formulation, I propose the following:

The formulation is Powderkg = 360, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat

This recommendation aims to investigate whether a lower powder content, combined with the optimal water-to-cement ratio and material blend, can achieve high compressive strength under heat curing conditions. It is a bold move away from the previously higher powder content formulations, and it will provide valuable data on the performance of such a mix.",65.26
