Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing",38.63
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing",51.22
"The formulation is Powderkg = 390, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing",52.0
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing",37.52
"The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",55.78
"Based on the previous results, I would suggest the following formulation for maximum compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",39.8
"Based on the previous suggestions and their respective strengths, I would suggest the following formulation for an even higher compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",56.56
"Based on the feedback received, I have analyzed the previous suggestions. To find an even better formulation, I will consider a unique combination that has not been validated before. 

The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing.",27.77
"Based on the previous suggestions, I will provide an even better formulation that has not been validated before. 

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",64.43
