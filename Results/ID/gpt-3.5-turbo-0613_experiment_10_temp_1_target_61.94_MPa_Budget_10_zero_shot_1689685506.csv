"Apologies for the repetition. Here is a new suggestion:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing, which is expected to result in a maximum compressive strength.

Please note that this is a prediction based on the provided design knowledge and previous laboratory validations. Actual lab testing is required to confirm the performance of the suggested formulation.",43.5
"Apologies for the repetitive suggestions. Thank you for seeking a new and unique formulation. Based on the available design knowledge and previous laboratory validations, here is a new suggestion:

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing, which is expected to result in a higher compressive strength compared to previous formulations.

Please note that this is a prediction and further laboratory testing is necessary to validate the performance of this formulation.",55.78
