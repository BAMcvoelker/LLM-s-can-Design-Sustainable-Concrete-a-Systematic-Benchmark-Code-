"Based on our previous results and the general design principles, I propose the following formulation for an outstanding recommendation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = heat curing.

This formulation pushes the boundaries by increasing the powder content to 420 kg/m³, which is the optimal value for heat curing conditions. The higher powder content will improve particle packing and enhance the pozzolanic reaction, leading to increased compressive strength.

The water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 strikes a balance between workability and strength, ensuring that the mixture is easy to handle while still achieving high strength.

By adjusting the FA/GGBFS ratio to 0.6/0.4, we introduce a higher proportion of fly ash, which is known to enhance the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete. This adjustment will further improve the overall strength of the mixture.

Lastly, heat curing is chosen as the curing method. Heat curing accelerates the geopolymerization process, resulting in faster strength development and higher compressive strength.

This bold and distinctive formulation aims to achieve exceptional compressive strength performance, surpassing previous results.",62.29
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for pushing boundaries and seeking the optimal solution. Based on your request, I propose the following distinctive and yet to be confirmed formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = heat curing.

In this formulation, we increase the powder content to 430 kg/m³, surpassing previous recommendations. This higher powder content will further improve particle packing and enhance the pozzolanic reaction, leading to increased compressive strength.

To achieve a lower water-to-cement ratio of 0.45, we reduce the amount of water in the mixture. This reduction in water content will result in a denser and stronger concrete, as it reduces the porosity and enhances the overall strength.

By adjusting the FA/GGBFS ratio to 0.7/0.3, we introduce a higher proportion of fly ash. This adjustment aims to maximize the benefits of fly ash, which is known to enhance the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete.

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = heat curing.

In this formulation, we increase the powder content to 450 kg/m³, surpassing previous recommendations. This higher powder content will further improve particle packing and enhance the pozzolanic reaction, leading to increased compressive strength.

To achieve a water-to-cement ratio of 0.55, we adjust the amount of water in the mixture. This ratio strikes a balance between workability and strength, ensuring that the mixture is easy to handle while still achieving high strength.

By maintaining the FA/GGBFS ratio at 0.5/0.5, we continue to benefit from the combined effect of fly ash and GGBFS. This balanced ratio aims to enhance the compressive strength of the geopolymer concrete.
