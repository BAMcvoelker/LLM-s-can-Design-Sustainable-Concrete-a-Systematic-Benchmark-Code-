"Based on the previous results and the general design knowledge, it seems that increasing the GGBFS content within the materials ratio and maintaining a low water-to-cement (WC) ratio, along with heat curing, has a positive impact on the compressive strength. However, we have not yet tested the highest powder content with the lowest WC ratio and the most balanced FA/GGBFS ratio. Therefore, I propose the following new formulation to potentially achieve even higher compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.

This formulation uses the highest powder content for density, the lowest WC ratio for strength, a balanced materials ratio for enhanced pozzolanic activity, and heat curing for accelerated geopolymerization. This combination is expected to provide a robust concrete mix with potentially the highest compressive strength we have seen yet.",54.97
