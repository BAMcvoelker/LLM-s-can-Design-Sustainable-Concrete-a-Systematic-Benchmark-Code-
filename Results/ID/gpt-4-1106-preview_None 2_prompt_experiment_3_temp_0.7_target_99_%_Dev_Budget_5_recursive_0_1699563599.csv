"Considering the previous results and aiming to improve upon the compressive strength, let's analyze the trends. The highest strength achieved was with a powder content of 430 kg and a water-to-cement ratio of 0.45, using a 0.6/0.4 ratio of Fly-Ash to GGBFS, and heat curing. To push the boundaries, we could increase the powder content slightly and adjust the materials ratio for potentially better performance.

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing

This formulation increases the powder content to the maximum of the provided range and uses the materials ratio that previously provided a strong result at a lower powder content. The heat curing method is retained due to its success in prior tests.",38.63
