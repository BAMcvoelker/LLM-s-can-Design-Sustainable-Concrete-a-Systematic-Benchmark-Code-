"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient",60.18
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat",57.54
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat",56.66
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient",60.38
"Based on the previous results and the general design principles, we can observe that a powder content of 420 kg and a W/C ratio of 0.5 under ambient curing conditions yielded the highest compressive strength of 60.38 MPa. To push the boundaries further and aim for an even higher compressive strength, we should consider adjusting the variables within the given parameters.

Given that we have seen a slight decrease in strength when increasing the powder content from 420 kg to 430 kg under heat curing, we might explore the possibility that there is an optimal point slightly below 420 kg for ambient curing. Additionally, since we have not yet tested the lower end of the W/C ratio under ambient conditions with a balanced FA/GGBFS ratio, we could explore this area.

Therefore, a bold yet unconfirmed recommendation could be to slightly reduce the powder content and lower the W/C ratio to its minimum within the given parameters, while keeping the materials ratio constant and opting for ambient curing, which has shown promising results.

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient

This recommendation aims to explore the potential of increased strength due to lower water",56.62
