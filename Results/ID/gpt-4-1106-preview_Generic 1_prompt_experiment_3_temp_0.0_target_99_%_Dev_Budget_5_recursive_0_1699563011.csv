"Based on the previous results and the general design principles, it seems that a powder content of 420 kg and a water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 are close to optimal under both curing conditions. However, since we are aiming to push boundaries and the previous best result under ambient curing was with a powder content of 420 kg, let's explore a slightly higher powder content under heat curing to see if we can enhance the strength further due to the hastened geopolymerization process.

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat

This recommendation is distinctive as it increases the powder content to 440 kg, which has not been confirmed yet, and it adheres to the optimal water-to-cement ratio and materials ratio that have been identified as beneficial for compressive strength. The heat curing is expected to accelerate the geopolymerization and potentially lead to higher compressive strength.",59.23
