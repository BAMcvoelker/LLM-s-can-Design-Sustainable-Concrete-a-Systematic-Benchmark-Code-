"My apologies for the confusion. Here is a new suggestion that has not been validated before:

The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing.",45.38
"Certainly! Here is a new suggestion that has not been validated before:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing, which is expected to result in a higher compressive strength.",51.92
