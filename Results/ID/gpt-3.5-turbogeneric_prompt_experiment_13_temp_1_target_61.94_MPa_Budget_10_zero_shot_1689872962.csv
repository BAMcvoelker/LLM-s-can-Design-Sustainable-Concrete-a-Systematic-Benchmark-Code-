Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing",56.66
"The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",61.61
"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",35.2
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing.",49.59

"The formulation is Powderkg = 390, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing.",37.18
"Based on the previous results, and to provide a unique suggestion, the next formulation to maximize compressive strength could be:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",58.93
"Apologies for the repetition. Here's a new unique suggestion:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",29.46
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing.",35.7
"Based on the previous suggestions and to provide a unique and potentially even better formulation, the next suggestion to maximize compressive strength could be:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",49.83
