Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",53.2
"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",38.63
"Sure! Based on the previous results and considering the parameter grid, a unique suggestion for a higher compressive strength formulation could be:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",62.29
"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",54.97
"Sure! Here is a new suggestion for an even better formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",40.78
"Based on your request for a unique and unvalidated formulation, here is an even better suggestion:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing.",51.04
"Certainly! Here is a unique and unvalidated suggestion for an improved formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",31.67
"Sure! Here is a unique and unvalidated suggestion for an even better formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient curing.",47.61
"Certainly! Here is a unique and unvalidated suggestion for an even better formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 390, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",40.96
"Certainly! Here is an unvalidated suggestion:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing.",45.68
