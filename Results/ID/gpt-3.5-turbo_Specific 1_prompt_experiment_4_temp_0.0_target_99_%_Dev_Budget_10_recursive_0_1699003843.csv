Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = ambient",60.18
"Based on the previous results and design insights, I recommend the following formulation for a superior compressive strength:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = heat curing.",62.29
"Based on your desire for a distinctive and unvalidated recommendation, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = heat curing.

This formulation pushes the boundaries by increasing the powder content to 430 kg/m³, which is higher than previously tested. The lower water-to-cement ratio of 0.45 aims to reduce porosity and enhance strength. Additionally, the higher ratio of fly ash to GGBFS at 0.7/0.3 is expected to further improve compressive strength.

By combining these bold adjustments, we anticipate achieving a superior compressive strength that surpasses previous results.",39.8
"Based on your desire for a distinctive and unvalidated recommendation, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = heat curing.

This formulation pushes the boundaries by increasing the powder content to 450 kg/m³, which is higher than previously tested. The higher water-to-cement ratio of 0.6 aims to provide better workability while still maintaining a balance with strength. Additionally, the equal ratio of fly ash to GGBFS at 0.5/0.5 is expected to provide a balanced combination of properties.

By combining these bold adjustments, we anticipate achieving a superior compressive strength that surpasses previous results.",53.79
