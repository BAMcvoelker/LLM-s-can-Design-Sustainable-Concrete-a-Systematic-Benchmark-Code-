Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing",40.78
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing",57.54
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing",51.04
"The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing",55.78
"Based on the previous results and aiming to push the boundaries for higher compressive strength, I recommend the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing

This recommendation is made with the assumption that increasing the powder content to the maximum of our parameter grid, while maintaining a low water-to-cement ratio and a balanced fly ash to GGBFS ratio, combined with heat curing, which has shown to be effective in previous tests, will likely result in a high compressive strength.",56.56
