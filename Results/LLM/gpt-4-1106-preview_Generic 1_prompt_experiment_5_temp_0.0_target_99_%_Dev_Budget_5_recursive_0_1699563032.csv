"Based on the previous results and the general design principles, it seems that a powder content of 420 kg and a water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 are close to optimal for both curing methods. However, since we are aiming to push boundaries and the last result with ambient curing at these parameters yielded the highest strength, let's explore a slight variation to see if we can enhance the strength further.

Given that we have not yet tested the lower end of the powder content with a balanced water-to-cement ratio and the optimal materials ratio under heat curing, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat

This recommendation is distinctive as it slightly reduces the powder content, which has not been tested with the optimal FA/GGBFS ratio and the ideal W/C ratio under heat curing conditions. This could potentially lead to an increase in compressive strength due to the balance between particle packing and the accelerated geopolymerization process under heat curing.",60.28
