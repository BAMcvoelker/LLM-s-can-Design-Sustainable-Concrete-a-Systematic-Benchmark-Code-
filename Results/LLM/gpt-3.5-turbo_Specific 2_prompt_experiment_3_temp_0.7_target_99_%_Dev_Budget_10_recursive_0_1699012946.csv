"Based on previous experiments and design principles, I propose the following formulation for an outstanding and yet to be confirmed optimal solution:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = heat.

This formulation pushes the boundaries by increasing the powder content to 420 kg/m³, taking advantage of the hastened geopolymerization process under heat curing conditions. With a balanced W/C ratio of 0.5, we ensure workability and strength. The 0.5/0.5 ratio of FA/GGBFS blend further enhances compressive strength due to the dominant presence of GGBFS.

By increasing the powder content and optimizing the materials blend, we anticipate a higher compressive strength compared to previous formulations. However, since this formulation is yet to be confirmed, it is crucial to conduct laboratory testing to validate its performance.",64.28
"I understand the need to push boundaries and strive for an outstanding and yet to be confirmed optimal solution. Based on the previous results and design principles, I propose the following formulation:

In this formulation, we increase the powder content to 430 kg/m³ to further enhance particle packing and the pozzolanic reaction. By reducing the W/C ratio to 0.45, we aim to minimize porosity and increase strength. The 0.5/0.5 ratio of FA/GGBFS blend continues to provide a balance between the two materials, contributing to improved compressive strength.
