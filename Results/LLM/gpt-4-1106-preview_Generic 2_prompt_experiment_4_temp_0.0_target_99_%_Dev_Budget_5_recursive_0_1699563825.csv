"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing",54.97
"The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing",57.27
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing",39.8
"Based on the previous results and the general design knowledge, it seems that a higher GGBFS content and a lower water-to-cement ratio contribute positively to the compressive strength. Given that we have already tested the highest powder content with a WC ratio of 0.45 and varying FA/GGBFS ratios, let's adjust the powder content slightly lower to see if we can optimize the mix further while maintaining a low WC ratio and a balanced FA/GGBFS ratio. We will also continue with heat curing to promote geopolymerization.

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing

This recommendation aims to balance the benefits of a high powder content with the enhanced pozzolanic activity of GGBFS, while keeping the WC ratio low for strength and using heat curing to ensure complete geopolymerization.",55.78
"Given the previous results and the need to explore a distinctive and unconfirmed formulation, let's consider a high powder content to ensure a dense matrix, but adjust the water-to-cement ratio and materials ratio slightly to explore a different balance that might lead to higher compressive strength. We will also continue with heat curing based on its proven effectiveness in enhancing strength.

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing

This recommendation is designed to test the impact of a slightly higher water-to-cement ratio, which may improve workability and could potentially lead to a better microstructure after heat curing, while still maintaining a high powder content and a favorable FA/GGBFS ratio for strength.",62.29
