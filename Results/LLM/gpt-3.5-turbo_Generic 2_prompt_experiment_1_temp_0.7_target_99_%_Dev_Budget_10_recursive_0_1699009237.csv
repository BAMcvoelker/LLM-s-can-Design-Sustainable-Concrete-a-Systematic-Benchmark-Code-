"Based on the previous results and the knowledge gained, I propose the following bold and distinctive formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.

This formulation aims to strike a balance between powder content, water-to-cement ratio, materials ratio, and curing method to achieve an outstanding compressive strength.

By increasing the powder content to 400kg, we are ensuring a denser concrete matrix, which can lead to improved compressive strength. 

Maintaining a water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 provides a good balance between workability and strength. 

Shifting the materials ratio to 0.6/0.4, with a higher proportion of Fly-Ash, enhances the pozzolanic activity, further strengthening the concrete.

Finally, utilizing heat curing accelerates the geopolymerization process, resulting in faster and more complete strength development.
