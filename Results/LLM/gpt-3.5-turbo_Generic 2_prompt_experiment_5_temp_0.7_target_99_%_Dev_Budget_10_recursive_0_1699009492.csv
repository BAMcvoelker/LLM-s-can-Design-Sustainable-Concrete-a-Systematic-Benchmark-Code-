Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = heat curing",38.63
"Based on our previous findings and the desire to push boundaries, I recommend the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = heat curing.

By increasing the GGBFS content to 50% and achieving a balanced ratio of 0.5/0.5 with fly ash, we can enhance the pozzolanic activity even further, leading to improved compressive strength.

Additionally, by maintaining a low water-to-cement ratio of 0.45, we can ensure that the cementitious matrix is not diluted, resulting in a stronger final product.

Finally, by utilizing heat curing, we can expedite the geopolymerization process and further enhance the compressive strength of the concrete.

This recommendation pushes the boundaries by maximizing the pozzolanic activity, minimizing the water content, and utilizing heat curing for faster geopolymerization. While unconfirmed, this formulation is expected to yield exceptional compressive strength results.",54.97
