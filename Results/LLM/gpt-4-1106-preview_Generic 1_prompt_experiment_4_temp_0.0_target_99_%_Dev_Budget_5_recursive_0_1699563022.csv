Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient",60.18
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat",57.54
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat",58.03
"The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat",55.78
"Based on the previous results and the general design principles, it seems that a powder content of 400 kg and a water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 with a 0.5/0.5 FA/GGBFS ratio under ambient curing conditions yielded a high compressive strength. However, to push the boundaries further and explore a distinctive and untested formulation, we can adjust the parameters slightly while still adhering to the principles that govern the strength characteristics.

Given that heat curing at 420 kg of powder content did not surpass the strength achieved at 400 kg under ambient conditions, and considering that a higher powder content under heat curing is expected to perform better, we can test the upper limit of the powder content under heat curing. Additionally, we will maintain the optimal FA/GGBFS ratio and water-to-cement ratio that have been shown to be effective.

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat

This recommendation is bold as it tests the highest powder content in combination with the optimal water-to-cement ratio and material blend under heat curing, which has not been confirmed yet. It aims to leverage the accelerated geopolymer",58.53
