"Based on the previous results and the general design knowledge, it seems that a higher GGBFS content and a lower water-to-cement ratio contribute positively to the compressive strength, especially when combined with heat curing. To push the boundaries further and considering that we have not yet tested the upper limit of the powder content with the lowest WC ratio and the balanced materials ratio, I propose the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.

This recommendation aims to leverage the benefits of a high powder content for a denser matrix, the lowest WC ratio for strength, a balanced materials ratio for enhanced pozzolanic activity, and heat curing for accelerated geopolymerization. This formulation is distinctive and has not been confirmed by previous tests.",56.56
