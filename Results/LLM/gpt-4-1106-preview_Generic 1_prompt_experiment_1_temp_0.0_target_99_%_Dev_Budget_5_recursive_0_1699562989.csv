Formulation,Compressive Strength
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient",60.18
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat",57.54
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat",58.03
"Based on the previous results and the general design principles, we should aim to optimize the mix further by adjusting the parameters within the given constraints. Since we have seen good results with a powder content of 400 kg and a water-to-cement ratio of 0.5 under ambient curing, we could explore the upper end of the powder content under heat curing to see if we can enhance the compressive strength further.

Given that a higher powder content under heat curing could potentially improve strength, and considering that we have already tested 420 kg with a wc ratio of 0.45, we should now test a slightly higher powder content with an optimal wc ratio. We should also maintain the materials ratio that has previously shown good results.

Therefore, I propose the following formulation for testing:

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat

This formulation is distinctive as it increases the powder content to 440 kg, which has not been confirmed yet, and uses the optimal wc ratio of 0.5 with a balanced FA/GGBFS ratio under heat curing conditions. This could potentially push the boundaries of compressive strength we have achieved so far.",59.23
