"The formulation is Powderkg = 390, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing",59.86
"The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing",43.5
"The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",51.54

"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Ambient curing.",38.43
"The formulation is Powderkg = 380, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient curing.",49.86
"My new suggestion for an improved concrete formulation is as follows:

The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",28.65
"Apologies for the previous suggestion, let's try a new formulation to improve the compressive strength. 

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",58.24
"I apologize for the limitations of the model. Here's another suggestion for an improved concrete formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Ambient curing.",51.04
"I apologize for any confusion caused. Here's a unique and unvalidated suggestion for an improved concrete formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",58.93
