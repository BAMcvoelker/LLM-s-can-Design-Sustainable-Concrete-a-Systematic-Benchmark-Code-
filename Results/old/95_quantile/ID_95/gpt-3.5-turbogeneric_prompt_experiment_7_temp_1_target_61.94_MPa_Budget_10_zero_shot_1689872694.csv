"The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",38.63
"The formulation is Powderkg = 440, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Heat curing.",53.2
"The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",61.51
"The formulation is Powderkg = 430, wc = 0.6, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",54.31
"My next suggestion is to try the following formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 390, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",40.96
"The formulation is Powderkg = 380, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",59.03
"Certainly! Based on the previous suggestions and feedback, I have considered a unique formulation that has not been validated before. 

The formulation is Powderkg = 400, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",43.19
"Apologies for not providing a unique suggestion earlier. Here is a new formulation:

The formulation is Powderkg = 450, wc = 0.5, materials = 0.6/0.4, curing = Heat curing.",61.3
"Certainly! Here is a unique and unvalidated suggestion:

The formulation is Powderkg = 410, wc = 0.45, materials = 0.5/0.5, curing = Ambient curing.",56.62
"Certainly! Here is a unique and unvalidated suggestion that may potentially yield even better results:

The formulation is Powderkg = 420, wc = 0.55, materials = 0.7/0.3, curing = Heat curing.",31.24
