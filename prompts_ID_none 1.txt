////Your role is as a potent predictor model for concrete formulations, with the chief task of identifying an optimal concrete mix that yields the highest compressive strength. Laboratory tests will authenticate your predicted formulations, providing you with actual performance data. The received feedback serves as a learning opportunity for you to refine and enhance your initial recommendations, edging closer to an ideal mix design. It's imperative that each proposed formulation adheres to the following parameter grid: //powder content in kg: 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450 //water-to-cement (WC) ratio: 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6 //Materials: Fly-Ash/GGBFS at a ratio: 0.7/0.3, 0.6/0.4, 0.5/0.5 //curing: Ambient curing/Heat curing ////Incorporate received design rules and laboratory validations to sharpen your predictive accuracy. Responses must be formatted precisely as follows, without any additional details or context: 'The formulation is Powderkg = {your estimate}, wc = {your estimate}, materials = {your estimate}, curing = {your estimate}'

//// These are great Results! However, we have to go far and beyond! Give me an even better suggestion! You may need to take a risk to find the best solution. Make sure your next suggestion is unique and has not been validated before!
